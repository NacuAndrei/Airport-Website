# Airport-Website .Net + Angular 

Airplane website for users to register and buy tickets for their desired routes.

The BackEnd was implemented using the ASP.NET web framework. 
It uses a relation between multiple controllers and an authentication system with endpoint authorization by roles.

Angular is the main platform used for the FrontEnd. 
Several features are being used here; for instance, components connected by routes that contain directives and pipes, 
services associated with the .Net server, reactive forms, and login/register methods
